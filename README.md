# personalbudget
For this project, you will build an API that allows clients to create and manage a personal budget. Using Envelope Budgeting principles, your API should allow users to manage budget envelopes and track the balance of each envelope. Your API should follow best practices regarding REST endpoint naming conventions, proper response codes, etc. Make sure to include data validation to ensure users do not overspend their budget!
